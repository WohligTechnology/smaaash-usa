      <h3>2.The Information We Collect</h3>
       <p>
In general, you can browse the non-password protected portions of our Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.  However, we collect your computer’s or mobile device’s IP address, which you necessarily disclose when you visit the Site, so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to your computer or device.  The Sites and Apps utilize “cookies,” which are text files placed on your computer or mobile device that web pages on the Site or App may use to store data on your computer or mobile device or to send data to our web server.  We may use cookie data to “recognize” you when you visit a Site or use an App in the future, to troubleshoot how the Sites or Apps operate, and for internal analysis of how people use the Sites and Apps.  Should you decide not to accept cookies from the Sites or Apps, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit and use the Sites or use our Apps.  We may also use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of the Sites or Apps. 

When you engage in certain activities on the Sites or Apps or use one of our Services, we may ask you to provide personal and other information.  In order to engage in such activities you will be required to provide information that lets us know the specifics of who you are, such as your name; e-mail address, postal address, and other contact information; payment information; and other information.  If we offer alternative sign ins, we may collect certain account and demographic information you have provided to third parties, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. when you sign on to use our Services, Sites, or Apps through these third parties. The information we collect will depend upon the activity; it is optional for you to engage in these activities.  Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some voluntary.  If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity or you limit your ability to use all or a portion of the Sites, Apps, or Services.  

Currently, our servers do not respond to browser “do not track” signals.  If you would like more information regarding online marketing practices and know your choices about not having this information used by our third party service providers, you may visit<a href="www.networkadvertising.org/choices">www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.

We may share this information with marketing partners, advertisers, and other parties with whom we collaborate.  We must release your credit card information or payment account information to credit card authorization service providers, payment processors, and associated banks to process your payments for products or services purchased from us.  In addition, if we use service providers, these service providers may have access to your personal information to perform contractually specified services on our behalf.
